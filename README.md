Description

This C++ project implements a RoadMap Optimization System using Dijkstra's Algorithm for the shortest path and A Algorithm* for the optimal route. It also calculates the estimated fare based on distance.

Features:

Dijkstra's Algorithm for shortest path
A Algorithm* with Manhattan distance heuristic
Fare Estimation based on travel distance

Requirements:

C++ Compiler (C++11 or later)
